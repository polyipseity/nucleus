## Patterns

The skill detects 24 patterns across five groups:

- Content
- Language and grammar
- Style
- Communication
- Filler and hedging

For the full numbered list with before/after examples, see `SKILL.md`.

## Example

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> The new software update serves as a testament to the company's commitment to innovation. Moreover, it provides a seamless, intuitive, and powerful user experience—ensuring that users can accomplish their goals efficiently.

**After (Humanized):**
> The software update adds batch processing, keyboard shortcuts, and offline mode. Early feedback from beta testers has been positive, with most reporting faster task completion.
